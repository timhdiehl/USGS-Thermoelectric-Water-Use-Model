## interactive FEWSR examples (the user selects the input file via a file dialog)

library("FEWSR")

fewsr(sheet = "Input", type = "pond", output = "csv")
# The sheet name is "Input" and the surface water is pond


fewsr(type = "river", output = "xlsx")
# The sheet number is 1 (default) and the surface water is river


fewsr(sheet = 4, type = "lake", output = "both")
# The sheet number is 4 and the surface water is lake



## non-interactive FEWSR examples (the user provides the input file)

library("FEWSR")

fewsr2(file.path(system.file("extdata", "FEWS_Pond_plants_input.xlsx",
package = "FEWSR")), type = "pond", output = "csv")
# The sheet number is 1 (default) and the surface water is pond



file <- "river_input.csv"
# it is assumed that the input file is located within your current working directory

fewsr2(file, type = "river", output = "xlsx"))
